		<div class="question-answer">
			<div class="question">
		   Can I buy Nintendo game systems and software at Nintendo New York and use them in another country?
		   </div>
			<div class="answer"><p>
		   Nintendo game systems, software and accessories sold at Nintendo New York are intended for use in the United States, Canada, Mexico and Latin America only. Other regions may have different: 
<br><br>
&rsaquo;&nbsp; Electrical standards <br>
&rsaquo;&nbsp; TV broadcast standards (e.g. PAL, NTSC, SECAM) <br>
&rsaquo;&nbsp; Languages (communication of operational instructions, precautions, warnings) <br>
&rsaquo;&nbsp; Government regulations (e.g. warranty, safety, electrical)<br>
&rsaquo;&nbsp; Marketing requirements (e.g. game ratings, packaging, advertising)
<br><br>
Due to these differences, products are made specifically for each country or region, and there is no way to ensure compatibility. Games and systems purchased for use in the US, Canada, Mexico and Latin America may not function properly in other countries, or may be difficult to use due to language barriers (manuals, warnings, screen text).<br><br> 
Nintendo recommends only purchasing products within the country or region where they products will be used. Nintendo distributors in other countries will not be able to repair or modify products made for use in other regions.
<br><br>Although Nintendo Switch software sold in regions outside of the Americas will work with Nintendo Switch systems sold in the Americas, we have not tested all overseas software with systems from all regions and cannot guarantee full service and support. Therefore, we recommend that players purchase software that is specifically made for their Nintendo Switch system's region.<br><br>   
If you live in a country other than the United States, Canada, Mexico or Latin America, you should contact a local distributor or retail location in that country for information on the availability of parts, accessories, Player's Guides and other products. A list of international distributors can be found at Nintendo of America's website by <a href="http://www.nintendo.com"><b>clicking here</a></b>.<br><br>
