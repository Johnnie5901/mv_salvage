{"body":"So I'm assuming what happened here is that Nintendo flubbed up the transition of this community being a dev-posts-only community to a general purpose community? That would explain the pre-redesign post organization style here, and the fact that the \"Developer's Room\" (under Related Commuinities) hasn't been populated with posts yet. So if that's the case, I'm guessing the 1000 character limit is how many characters devs usually get for their own posts?
