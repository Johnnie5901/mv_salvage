			<p>&emsp;To stay engaged with our consumers, we must constantly provide them with new surprises and experiences. When it comes to entertainment, consumers can eventually become tired of even highly popular products.<br />
			&emsp;With this in mind, Nintendo has worked hard to develop products that anyone, regardless of age or gaming experience, can enjoy. We have utilized our strengths, software-hardware integrated development, our expansive creativity, and our characters, beloved for many generations, to achieve those ends.<br>
			&emsp;We always seek out new potential in videogames, taking advantage of our ability to create products that you will naturally be able to use without having to resort to reading manuals and our ability to create experiences that keep you coming back for more. We would not be able to do this, of course, without the deep knowledge and experience we have accumulated over the years of creating these products.</p>

						<p>Nintendo DS, launched in 2004, is a dual-screen handheld video game system that can be used with a stylus. Its intuitive method of operation was well received by people of all ages. Utilizing the system's features, we have been able to offer a new software category that enables people to enjoy playing games while also training their brains and learning how to draw.</p>

						<p>Nintendo 3DS, launched in 2011, has the same dual-screen and intuitive-operation features as Nintendo DS, but users also can enjoy playing games with stereoscopic 3D visuals. To fully utilize the dynamic capabilities of making images appear to jump out of the screen and create a sense of depth, we released the <em>3D Pictorial Guide to Flora and Fauna</em> and a 3D museum audio guide, further expanding the scope of video games.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Strict Safety Standards</h4>
					<p>&emsp;To ensure that our products are safe for everyone, especially young children, Nintendo has established its own design safety standards for product development. In addition to complying with the legal requirements for product safety that apply to consumer electronic products, we draw upon various other safety standards such as the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008<sup>*1</sup>, the European Toy Safety Directive<sup>*2</sup> and the Toy Safety Standards of Japan<sup>*3</sup>.</p>
					<dl class="notes">
						<dt>*1 <strong>Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act of 2008</strong></dt>
						<dd>This U.S. regulation restricts the use of phthalate compounds in products as well as the use of various materials, such as lead.</dd>
						<dt>*2 <strong>Toy Safety Directive</strong></dt>
						<dd>This European Union (EU) directive regulates products designed or clearly intended, whether or not exclusively, for use in play by children under 14 years of age. Such products must meet strict safety requirements related to physical, mechanical, flammable, chemical and electrical properties.</dd>

					<h4 class="h4">Framework for Product Safety Assurance</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo Co., Ltd. established its Product Safety Committee, under the direct supervision of the Executive Management Committee, to ensure employees' thorough understanding of the Product Safety and Quality Principles. Through effective management, maintenance and improvement of the system, the Product Safety Committee ensures the safety of our products at every stage, from planning, development, production and sales, all the way through after-sales service.</p>
					<div id="process">
						<p class="image"><img src="img/quality_img.gif" width="750" height="202" alt="System to Ensure Product Safety" /></p>
						<h5>The Development Stage</h5>
						<p>&emsp;The Design Safety Review Committee consists of employees from several divisions, including Manufacturing, Quality Assurance and Legal Affairs. The committee screens product designs for safety, particularly during the design and development stages. The committee reviews prototypes and reports created by the product development departments to assess the safety of each product from a wide range of perspectives. During the prototype stage, mechanical and physical evaluations include drop tests, electrical integrity, Ordinance for Enforcement of the Radio Act compliance, flammability tests, and tests that screen for harmful chemical substances. To perform these tests, we use a full range of testing devices at our facilities to ensure product compliance. We also require external agencies to certify product compliance as needed.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Stereoscopic 3D Display Considerations</h4>
					<div class="text">
						<p>&emsp;Nintendo 3DS, Nintendo 3DS XL, New Nintendo 3DS and New Nintendo 3DS XL from the Nintendo 3DS family of gaming systems enable users to enjoy 3D images without the use of special glasses. 3D visuals are created by projecting different images to the left and right eyes. However, perception of the 3D visuals can differ significantly from person to person. For example, a person with significantly different eyesight in the left and the right eye might have difficulty seeing 3D images. For this reason, Nintendo has incorporated the 3D depth slider. This slider enables a player to adjust the strength of the 3D visuals<sup>*6</sup>. Lowering the slider gradually diminishes the 3D effect of the visuals. When the slider is all the way down, users can enjoy playing the game in 2D. This feature enables users to play any game at the level they find most appropriate.<br />
						&emsp;In addition, some studies indicate that vision may still be developing for children aged six and under, and that allowing those children to see 3D images by projecting different images to their left and right eyes might affect their visual development. To enable all consumers to enjoy systems in the Nintendo 3DS family with peace of mind, Nintendo makes it possible to play all Nintendo 3DS games in 2D display mode. We also enable parents and guardians to restrict the display of 3D images using a Parental Controls feature. Once a parent or guardian has set the restriction, the 3D feature will remain restricted until a parent or guardian unlocks it using a PIN code.<br />
						&emsp;We also are working hard to ensure that consumers are aware of this information by displaying it in prominent locations, such as the packaging, so that before purchasing a system in the Nintendo 3DS family, consumers can make informed choices as to whether or not their children should experience 3D images.</p>

							<dd>The depth of some 3D content, such as distributed 3D videos, 3D images or certain 3D game software, cannot be adjusted with the 3D depth slider. If this content is difficult or uncomfortable to view, try varying the distance between your eyes and the screen, or turn the 3D effect off by moving the 3D depth slider all the way down to the OFF setting.</dd>

						<p>&emsp;To ensure that all Nintendo products meet the highest standards of safety and quality, it is essential to educate all Nintendo employees about product safety. To make sure our employees are well aware of the critical importance of ensuring the safety of our products, Nintendo Co., Ltd. provides product safety training where necessary. In fiscal year 2015, Nintendo Co., Ltd. provided product safety training for 58 new recruits.<br />
							&emsp;In addition, our design and manufacturing guidelines incorporate a wealth of knowledge and experience, and aim to share craftsmanship know-how with related employees. Since fiscal year 2011, we have been making our developers' craftsmanship knowledge and past experiences available on our corporate intranet so that employees not directly involved in this area of the business can view this information at any time.</p>

					<h4>Promote Internal Communication to Increase Consumers' Smiles</h4>
					<p class="mb_10">&emsp;At Nintendo Co., Ltd., we believe that in order to enhance consumer satisfaction, interdepartmental understanding is fundamental to every effort. To this end, we set up the Smile-Spreading Project in 2009. To deepen employees' mutual understanding, this project undertook various initiatives such as the Delivery Seminar, in which employees visited other departments to describe their own department's role in the company; the Internal Exchange Program, in which employees spent some time in another department to learn about that department's role; and the Group Discussion & Customer Service Window Tour, in which employees observed the work of the Customer Service Window. These initiatives contributed to an improvement in our internal system to share consumer feedback. Overall, employees reported that participation in this project not only provided them with a good opportunity to learn about other departments, it also gave them a fresh perspective.<br />
						&emsp;Since the project's launch, 5,300 employees have attended Delivery Seminars, and 350 employees have attended the Group Discussion & Customer Service Window Tour.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Principles on Ensuring Software Safety</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo continually offers new ways to play games such as using the entire body to manipulate the gaming system or by using an online network. Thus, in order for consumers to safely play with our products with peace of mind, we have created comprehensive software development guidelines that are updated and revised as needed, and distributed among the related departments. Based on these guidelines, we have created a company-wide system that checks for the safety of our software from the earliest stages of product development.</p>

						&emsp;For further improvement, starting in January 2010, Nintendo Co., Ltd. changed the color of the packages for Wii software sold in Japan to enable consumers to notice the age rating more easily. <br />

					<h4 class="h4">A Healthy Environment for Children</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo has integrated Parental Controls into all game systems released in and after December 2006. This feature enables parents and guardians to restrict and limit their children's access to high age-rating software or online content.<br />
						&emsp;In an effort to promote the use of Parental Controls, Nintendo Co., Ltd. has a section on its website called Information for Parents. This section aims to address specific questions that parents and guardians may have about our products, such as what features they contain and how to set up Parental Controls. In addition to creating a downloadable brochure summarizing the main Parental Controls features for parents and guardians who would like to read about this topic offline, we also broadcast an informative TV commercial.<br />
						&emsp;In addition to providing this information, Nintendo Co., Ltd. has been holding seminars on appropriate use of video game systems for school supporters<sup>*8</sup> and educators throughout Japan since fiscal year 2013. During the seminar, Nintendo staff members explain how to use Nintendo's video game systems, and offer a hands-on session in which attendees use Nintendo 3DS systems to learn about Parental Controls and filtering service settings. A total of 750 people have attended the 14 seminars.<br />
						&emsp;Our overseas subsidiaries also endeavor to provide detailed information on hardware features and functions by placing video tutorials, Q&amp;As and step-by-step instructions on their websites to increase awareness and the use rate of Parental Controls.</p>

A symposium was held in Kyoto in February of 2016 to not only share the latest and current information on the subject, but also to offer advice on avoiding problems online. The symposium involved children and their guardians, educators, and industry personnel.<br />
						&emsp;Nintendo Co., Ltd. attended the symposium as a trainer, speaking on ways children can use video game systems safely. The call was raised for more effective use of the Parental Controls feature. We also participated as a panelist, along with children, the Kyoto Prefectural Police advisor on Internet safety, and an ad hoc instructor for cellphone use from the Kyoto Municipal Board of Education, in a workshop on online problems.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Know More About What Your Children Play</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo feels that providing ways for parents and guardians to become more involved in their children's gaming experiences encourages better communication. For this reason, we designed Wii, Wii U and the Nintendo 3DS family of systems to automatically record which game titles are played and for how long each day so that parents and guardians can be better informed about their children's gaming activities.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Eliminating Inappropriate Content in Communication Features</h4>
					<p class="mb_20">&emsp;Some software and applications are designed to enable user-generated content (UGC), such as user-generated images, text and music, which can be shared with other users. Such software encourages expansive communication by enabling consumers to express themselves more freely. However, in rare instances, some individuals intentionally could create an unpleasant situation for other consumers by distributing inappropriate content. To minimize inadvertent user exposure to inappropriate content, we have incorporated a user reporting function for inappropriate content into certain services that enable users to communicate and exchange content. Problematic content is removed immediately. <br />
&emsp;In addition, we monitor the content on Miiverse, our online community that lets users connect with other players around the world via their personal avatars, their Mii<sup>*9</sup> characters, and if we find inappropriate posts, we remove them.</p>
					<div class="text">
						<div class="case">
							<h4>Nintendo 3DS Series Efforts</h4>
							<p>&emsp;On the Nintendo 3DS family of systems, we have strengthened measures to prevent unintentional exposure to inappropriate content. At the same time, we have improved strategies to protect individual privacy. For example, you can attach a message to a Mii, then exchange that message in StreetPass<sup>*10</sup>; however, we have implemented safeguards that make it difficult to include vulgar words and personal information, both in the name of the Mii and in the message.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Protecting Consumer Information</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo respects consumers' privacy and considers the protection of consumer information an important responsibility.<br />
					&emsp;The information Nintendo collects from consumers largely consists of information necessary for the provision of network services and contact details when carrying out product repairs. We always clearly specify how we will use consumer information in our terms of use and strictly handle this information in adherence with internal regulations. In addition, we revise and enhance our internal systems in compliance with the laws and standards related to the handling of information.</p>

				<div id="safety_price" class="section mb_50">
					<h4 class="h4">Establishing Payment Caps</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Though some of Nintendo's software and services can be purchased online through Nintendo eShop, Parental Controls settings can restrict purchases.<br />
					&emsp;Users can download the Nintendo 3DS software title, <em>Collectible Badge Center</em>, (translation of Japanese title) for free; however, they can choose to make in-game purchases. For this title, the monthly payment cap for consumers of all ages in Japan is 10,000 yen.<br />
					&emsp;Each overseas subsidiary makes decisions about what is most appropriate for its market and suits its culture.</p>

				<div id="safety_smart" class="section mb_50">
					<h4 class="h4">Considerations for Smart Device Software</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo began offering its first application for smart devices in March of 2016. We remain committed to our involvement in marking applications for appropriate age ranges, in creating systems to remove inappropriate content, in preventing problems before they occur, and in detecting issues early on to allow consumers to use applications for smart devices safely as well.</p>
				</div><!-- /.section -->

				<div id="safety_info" class="section">
					<h4 class="h4">Compliance System for Payment Services Laws</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Nintendo offers consumers the Nintendo eShop Cards payment method. With this type of payment method, we receive money from consumers in advance of providing the products or services, so we must avoid a situation in which we cannot provide them. To ensure that consumers can enjoy our products and services with peace of mind, we have a system to review and comply with applicable laws in each country.<br />
					&emsp;At Nintendo Co., Ltd., payment methods such as Nintendo Prepaid Cards are subject to the Prepaid Payments Instruments chapter of the Payment Services Act. Therefore, we have registered as an issuer that abides by the provisions of Prepaid Payments Instruments and established a system to comply with the Payment Services Act under the supervision of the Financial Services Agency and Kinki Local Finance Bureau.<br />
					&emsp;As part of our efforts in this regard, we held an internal seminar in fiscal year 2014 for 515 employees to build awareness for the importance of consumer protection. We also implemented an e-learning program in fiscal year 2015 within our intranet platform. That attracted 206 participants. We went on to host workshops for leads in departments developing software.</p>

								<h4>Wii U System</h4>
								<p>&emsp;After evaluating consumer feedback regarding Wii, we incorporated a synchronization (SYNC) button, which is used to connect a controller with the Wii U system, in an easily recognizable location on the Wii U console. The Wii system's SYNC button was located next to the SD card slot and hidden by the slot cover. Since the button on Wii U is on the surface of the console and is not under the slot cover, users can locate it at a glance.<br />
									&emsp;While the Wii slot cover protrudes out from the Wii console when it is open, the Wii U slot cover slides neatly inside the console so that it is not in the way.<br />
									&emsp;In addition, there is a USB port on the front of the console as well as on the back so that users can connect USB devices to it easily.</p>

						&emsp;In addition, we consider the readability of the Nintendo 3DS electronic manual and provide users with the choice of two font sizes.</p>

					<h4 class="h4">Delivering Product Appeal That Overcomes Cultural &amp; Language Barriers</h4>
					<p>&emsp;Game localization refers to the process of adapting software that has been developed for one country to another, without losing the appeal or feeling of the game world to give it a look and feel that local consumers can enjoy.<br />
&emsp;At Nintendo, when software developed by Nintendo Co., Ltd. is localized for overseas markets, the localization staff closely communicate with the game developers to make sure they incorporate aspects of the local culture and fine details that will entertain consumers while bringing out the game's original appeal.<br />
&emsp;When games developed overseas are localized for the Japanese market, the same process occurs; the localization team in each country is directly involved during the content review process.</p>
