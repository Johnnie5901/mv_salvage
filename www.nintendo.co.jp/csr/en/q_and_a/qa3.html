				<p class="int pt_20">It has become a global concern that companies using minerals from conflict-affected regions could be playing a role in the conflicts by financing armed groups.</p>
				<p class="int">In the U.S., Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Act, effective January 2013, requires companies listed in the U.S. disclose the use of any of the four conflict minerals (gold, tantalum, tin and tungsten) which are extracted from the Democratic Republic of the Congo or its adjoining countries and become a funding source for armed groups, are used in those companies' products, and if so, those companies must disclose, among other matters, the measures taken to exercise due diligence on the sourcing of those minerals.</p>
				<p class="int pt_20">Although Nintendo is not subject to the law since we are not publicly listed in the U.S., Nintendo has an unequivocal policy banning the use of conflict minerals that support armed groups. As a result, Nintendo has carried out the following activities.</p>

							<th>FY 2013</th>
							<td>&emsp;Nintendo reorganized its internal structure and established a cross-functional conflict minerals team, consisting of members from legal, procurement and manufacturing to enhance Nintendo's approach on conflict minerals.<br />
							
							&emsp;We used the internationally recognized CFSI<sup>*1</sup> Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to conduct our supply chain survey. <br />
							&emsp;Moreover, we reviewed all results to ensure there were no inconsistencies and no questions remained unanswered, carrying out follow-up requests with production partners when necessary. We also used the CFS (Conflict-Free Smelter)<sup>*2</sup> list to verify smelters and refiners in our survey.<br />
							&emsp;We sent feedback to production partners regarding their individual survey results, and asked for their continued cooperation with Nintendo's efforts based on our risk assessment of their status.<br />
						  &emsp;In addition to conducting the supply chain survey, we worked with an external expert to interview our priority production partners at their sites and further examine both the progress made on their supply chain investigations and the challenges they currently faced.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>FY 2014</th>
							<td>&nbsp; Our cross-functional team continued to advance efforts regarding conflict minerals. We updated the Nintendo CSR Procurement Guidelines to include our conflict minerals policy and added language requiring production partners to cooperate with our supply chain survey, using a reporting template developed by CFSI, and to put into place a conflict minerals policy of their own. At the July 2014 Green Procurement briefing, we again used this time to explain Nintendo's policy on conflict minerals and to request that production partners to participate in our supply chain investigation.<br />
							&nbsp; We achieved a 100 percent response rate to our fiscal year 2014 investigation, which used the CFSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, and as in the past, we reviewed all results and carried out follow-up requests when necessary.<br />
							&nbsp; According to the results, Nintendo's supply chain consists of 355 smelters and refiners, including some that have not yet been identified by CFSI. We compared them against the list of smelters and refiners prepared by CFSI to ascertain the status of each mineral. As a result, from the smelters and refiners reported, 247 were on the CFSI Standard Smelter List, and among them 168 were certified as conflict free by CFSI.<br />
							&nbsp; To promote further efficiency in our investigation, we carried out a risk assessment of our production partners' supply chain survey results and their overall importance to Nintendo's business. We also worked with an external CSR expert to interview selected production partners, to further examine the progress made on their supply chain investigations and the challenges they faced and their overall CSR initiatives.<br />
							&nbsp; The results of our conflict minerals survey and interviews with suppliers have been reported to Nintendo's Executive Management Committee. Nintendo will continue to refrain from using any conflict minerals in our products, and we will further refine our conflict minerals investigation process.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<th>FY 2015</th>
							<td>&nbsp; To promote our initiatives according to the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Conflict Minerals<sup>*3</sup>, we continued our cross-departmental efforts to investigate conflict minerals based on our conflict mineral investigation manual defining responsibility and authority, and investigation procedure.<br />
							&nbsp; Within the survey conducted in fiscal year 2015, which used the CFSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template, we identified examples of mistakes our production partners had often made on the survey in the previous fiscal year, such as incorrect recording of smelter information, and asked our production partners to pay special attention to such issues. The response rate to the written surveys was again 100 percent.<br />
							&nbsp; We examined the responses in the same way as the past, and where there were clear contradictions, such as when a mineral is marked as not being in use, but a refiner is listed for that mineral, we asked all applicable production partners to review and resubmit their responses to ensure answers were consistent and correct.<br />
							&nbsp; According to our investigation, Nintendo's supply chain consists of 309 smelters and refiners (including some that could not be identified as smelters or refiners by CFSI). We compared these against the CFSI Standard Smelter List, to analyze how smelters and refiners are specified for each mineral. As a result, from the smelters and refiners reported, 294 were on the CFSI Standard Smelter List, and among them, 223 were certified as conflict-free by CFSI and 23 are on the Active list<sup>*4</sup>. The remaining CFSI Standard Smelters were not validated as CFS or engaged in the audit process, but as far as we have reviewed the provided information from production partners, our surveys revealed no evidence of conflict mineral use by those smelters either. In addition to our survey activities, we have been conducting interviews with our productions partners since fiscal year 2013 with the belief that communicating directly with our production partners, and having an in-depth understanding of the framework and the procedures used in their supply chain investigation, can eventually lead to a higher level of involvement. In fiscal year 2015, we selected production partners on the basis of risk assessments, taking into account their survey responses and the importance of the business relationship, and interviewed them on the status and challenges of their conflict minerals supply chain investigations, as well as their overall CSR initiatives.<br />
							&nbsp; The results of our surveys and interviews with production partners were reported to the management of Nintendo Co., Ltd., who use that information to define steps to further reduce the risk of using conflict minerals that support armed groups.</td>

				<p class="pt_30"><strong>FY 2016 Progress</strong></p>
				<p class="int pt_20">In fiscal year 2016, we continued our cross-departmental efforts to address the conflict minerals issue by investigating our supply chain. Our investigation is in line with the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Conflict Minerals and is based on our conflict mineral investigation manual that defines responsibility and authority, and investigation procedure. Our basic policy on conflict minerals is outlined in the Nintendo CSR Procurement Guidelines, which we distribute to production partners.</p>
				<p class="int pt_10">Nintendo utilizes the CFSI Conflict Minerals Reporting Template to conduct our written survey as a part of our assessment of production partners to ensure they are complying with the Nintendo CSR Procurement Guidelines, and the response rate to the written survey in fiscal year 2016 was 100 percent. We verify all survey responses for inconsistencies or uncalculated items with the JAMA<sup>*5</sup> calculation tool in an effort to improve the overall accuracy of responses received. When inconsistencies or omissions are found, we require the production partner to correct any issues and resubmit their survey response.</p>
				<p class="int pt_10">According to our investigation, Nintendo's supply chain consists of 329 smelters and refiners (including some that could not be identified as smelters or refiners by CFSI). We compared these smelters and refiners against the CFSI Standard Smelter List to analyze the certification status of each mineral. As a result, 308 of the smelters and refiners reported were on the CFSI Standard Smelter List, and among them, 242 were certified as conflict-free smelters (CFS) and 10 are on the Active list. The remaining CFSI Standard Smelters were not validated as CFS or engaged in the audit process, but as far as we have reviewed the information provided by production partners, the surveys revealed no evidence of the use of conflict minerals that aid armed groups by those smelters either.</p>
				<p class="int pt_10">To further our investigation, we use the survey responses to determine an appropriate course of action according to the level of risk and conditions of the business transaction. When deemed necessary, we visit our production partners to discuss the status and challenges of their conflict minerals investigation, and we engaged with multiple production partners in fiscal year 2016.</p>
				<p class="int pt_10">The results of our surveys and interviews with production partners have been reported to the management of Nintendo Co., Ltd., who will use this information to define steps to further reduce the risk of using conflict minerals that support armed groups.</p>
				<p class="int pt_10">We will continue to advance efforts on the issue of conflict minerals throughout our supply chain by continuing to communicate closely with our production partners, and requiring them to set conflict minerals policies and use CFS smelters.</p>
