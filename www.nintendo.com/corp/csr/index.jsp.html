					<h3 class="corp-content-list-header">Conflict Minerals</h3>
					<p class="paragraphTopMargin">Nintendo takes its social responsibility as a global company very seriously. We have an unequivocal policy banning the use of conflict minerals that benefit armed groups in any of our products, and we expect our production partners to do the same. Because Nintendo outsources the manufacture and assembly of all Nintendo products to its production partners, we established the Nintendo CSR Procurement Guidelines based on relevant laws, international standards and guidelines that focus on protecting human rights, ensuring workplace safety, promoting corporate ethics and safeguarding the environment. We share these guidelines with all of our production partners.</p>
					<p>These guidelines require our production partners to establish a policy banning the use of conflict minerals and investigate the source of materials in our products by using the internationally recognized CFSI conflict minerals reporting tool.
					<p>We continue to actively work with our production partners in our supply chain to prevent conflict minerals that benefit armed groups from being used in our products.</p>
